Inr Management

This is a Work in Progress Project/ Cancelled
==================================

The idea to that project began in 2020 after my pulmonary embolism and began to rise in 2021 where I
became an patient in self management. What is a great thing, because you'll get an more normal life back.
But there are no good apps and this whole thing is a lot of paper and pen work, that I don't like.
Now here is the first base Version, not fully completed and my first real project in Jetpack compose.

How the title says it's a work in progress project, which I definitely will develop further.

This Version is newly formed within the scope of the android module in an App Developer further education.
Exactly said within the scope of the 2 month project of the android module.

Compose was not part of the module, just xml-view. But I made the decision to realize this project
with compose. I went through the codelab's for compose and the rest on the run. And did it without support.

Yes they are a few bugs 3 of which I know, yes there are no unit tests at the moment, I don't like that too.
That are things that will be changed in a not so far away future.
I've made the decision to set it on public anyway. The reason is simple, for job applications. 
At the moment I'm in that course because of an unwanted nearly 2 years break, because of the pandemic,
where it was hard for a junior developer who quit the old job a short period of time before pandemic start,
and my pulmonary embolism which took a little bit of time too, to recover from that.

Before that I was IT Specialist and Junior Dev. I know I made mistakes, the biggest one was that I tried
to build my own calendar and datePicker components, not that I tried, that would be mad to feel sorry for trying
something new. But for the fact that I was like a little pitbull that tightly bitten something.
That where 2 of my 8 Weeks, so that, what you'll find here is at least the work of 6 weeks. I feel 
sorry for the time to long I've tried that solution, to end up with a rollback of 900rows of code. 
Sad but did it and learned of it.

Oh yes nearly forgotten, the time in the near future will not be a lot, I think one day a week for 
bug fixing and to develop it further. Because now starts the iOS module and SwiftUI is awaiting me, 
again don't belongs to the course the declarative UI but I like them and for my App I want them.
And the best is.... I won't do the same mistakes again. In iOS I will start my project from the be-
ginning with tdd, won't play pittbull again, things like that.

## UPDATE: I've made the decision to wait with further development, because Google finished Material Design 3 but the implementation in Compose isn't finished. But when it's finished I can throw away the libraries that I've never liked to implement but didn't have another choice at that moment. So I've made the decision to wait on this one for the moment. And to take care for the iOS version in SwiftUI.

Hope you'll enjoy it anywhere and feel free to give useful and constructive feedback. 

Have a nice day
